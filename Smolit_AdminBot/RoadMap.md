# RoadMap.md

1. Security Enhancements

Current State:

    The repository includes setup_permissions.sh for setting file permissions.
    It leverages daemon for secure operation.

Improvements:

    Input Validation:
        Ensure all user inputs (commands, configuration values) are validated to prevent injection attacks.
        Use Python libraries like re for strict pattern validation.

    Enhanced Logging:
        Add structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) with security audit trails.
        Example:

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(
        format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s',
        level=logging.INFO,
        handlers=[logging.FileHandler("rootbot_audit.log"), logging.StreamHandler()]
    )

File Integrity Monitoring:

    Use hashes (e.g., SHA-256) to validate the integrity of critical files like rootbot.conf or executables before use.
    Example:

        import hashlib
        def check_file_integrity(filepath, expected_hash):
            with open(filepath, "rb") as f:
                file_hash = hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()
            return file_hash == expected_hash

    Restricted Execution Environment:
        Use AppArmor or SELinux to sandbox the RootBot process.
        Add strict rules in the rootbot.service file for systemd.

2. Reliability Improvements

Current State:

    The bot supports clean shutdowns and memory management but may not handle service restarts effectively.

Improvements:

    Process Monitoring:
        Use a watchdog process to ensure the bot remains active.
        Example using psutil:

    import psutil
    def is_process_running(pid):
        try:
            psutil.Process(pid)
            return True
        except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
            return False

Retry Mechanism:

    Implement retries for failed tasks or LLM interactions.
    Example:

        import time
        def retry_on_failure(func, retries=3, delay=5):
            for _ in range(retries):
                try:
                    return func()
                except Exception as e:
                    time.sleep(delay)
            raise Exception("Retries exhausted")

    Graceful Error Handling:
        Wrap critical sections with detailed error handling to log and recover from exceptions.

3. Support for More Event Types

Current State:

    The bot monitors system resources and handles basic termination signals.

Improvements:

    File System Events:
        Use libraries like watchdog to monitor file changes.
        Example:

    from watchdog.observers import Observer
    from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

    class ConfigChangeHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
        def on_modified(self, event):
            if event.src_path == "rootbot.conf":
                print("Configuration changed, reloading...")

Custom Alerts:

    Add triggers for events like excessive disk usage or unauthorized access attempts.
    Example:

        if disk_usage("/") > 90:
            alert("Disk usage exceeded threshold")

    Process-Level Events:
        Monitor specific system processes (e.g., sshd, nginx) and respond to failures.

4. Proactive Recovery Mechanisms

Current State:

    Recovery mechanisms are limited to stopping and restarting the bot manually.

Improvements:

    Self-Healing Tasks:
        Restart tasks or processes that fail during execution.
        Example:

    def restart_failed_task(task):
        if not task.is_alive():
            task.restart()

Service Auto-Restart:

    Update the rootbot.service file to include Restart=always for automatic restarts.

    [Service]
    Restart=always

Resource Cleanup:

    Add a periodic cleanup routine to release unused resources.
    Example:

        def cleanup_resources():
            for temp_file in os.listdir("/tmp"):
                os.remove(temp_file)

Implementation Plan
1. Security

    Implement structured logging with audit trails.
    Add AppArmor/SELinux profiles to sandbox the bot.

2. Reliability

    Add a watchdog script to monitor the botâ€™s PID.
    Use retry mechanisms for critical operations like LLM queries.

3. Event Types

    Integrate watchdog for file system event monitoring.
    Add CPU, disk, and memory alert triggers.

4. Recovery

    Enable automatic service restart in rootbot.service.
    Add self-healing logic for task restarts.
